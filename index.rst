Elcodi Documentation
====================

Hello World!
------------

`Elcodi`_ is a suite of e-commerce components developed for
`Symfony2 Framework`_.

It aims to promote `SOLID`_ principles, efficient `code reutilization`_, `separation of concerns`_ as effective building blocks for the development of e-commerce applications or components with the `Symfony PHP Framework`_

Rather than provide a single, monolithic application, the codebase is splitted in `various projects`_, each with its own subtree-splitted repositories, so that dependencies can be controlled and fine-tuned by the enveloping Symfony application utilizing Elcodi components.

Elcodi is now in an early development stage and provides a reference implementation for the basic :doc:`core components <bundles/index>` found in e-commerce web projects.

Don't worry! We have plenty of material to polish and sort out. Commits will be frequent. 


.. note::

    This documentation assumes that you have a fairly good knowledge of the 
    Symfony2 full stack framework and at least some experience with the `Symfony Standard Edition`_ distribution. 
    If you don't, please jump to the `Quick Tour`_ on the Symfony documentation repository.
